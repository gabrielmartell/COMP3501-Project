This project contains our assignment 6 which follows our plan for the map in our group project.

	What has been changed: 
	   - We've created a function to make a plane with a given number of vertices.
	   - The plane can have any number of quads that are all connected through it's faces.
	   - In the function, we've made a heightmap generator, to show and implement the crater with the YValue.
	   - We've also implemented proper movement for a character.

//!!/ We've marked most of the comments with, //!/ so that it can easily be found by Intructors/TAs with ctrl-f :).
